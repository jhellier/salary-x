Companies have a wide range of profitability yet in the tech industry the average salary is just that an average. In Silicon Valley,
the average salary for a senior software engineer is ~150K. Yet there are companies such as Apple and Facebook that are
very profitable and could easily pay 50-100% higher and not have it hit the profit margin very hard. While other
companies are losing money and are barely able to pay the average salary. So why don't companies like Apple and Facebook
pay a lot more and completely dominate the market. This code puts together some visualizations that look at this phenomena.
